Given the java file provided, simply modifying the map stage to include an extra key, value pair for line count completes the assignment.
This is due to the fact that the program already combines the key value pairs in the reduce stage, so adding a term with the given name will be combined just the same.
The answer thus can be found at the bottom of part-r-00000 due to it being sorted alphabetically.
For the given input the output is 258 lines.
